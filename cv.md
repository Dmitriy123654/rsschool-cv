# About Myself:

Currently, I am a second-year student of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, studying at the Faculty of Information Technology and Management in the specialty "Automated Information processing systems".

I am an inquisitive person who always strives to learn and accept new challenges. In my free time from studies and courses, I do sports.

I am already familiar with such things as: C#, Entity Framework, MSSQL, MySQL, Razor Pages, network programming, Git; Аt a basic level I know HTML, CSS, ASP.NET , C++ .
